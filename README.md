# Archiconda3

## Intro

`Archiconda3` is a distribution of `conda` for 64-bit ARM. Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Like `Virtualenv`, Anaconda also uses the concept of creating environments so as to isolate different libraries and versions. The goal of this repository is to develop the groundwork needed to compile conda-forge on `aarch64`. Once that is laid out, we will be working toward backporting much of this work to conda-forge

## Setup

Since Archiconda3 is tailored for `ARM64` computer (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Devices), the setup process is different from the one with the normal Anaconda. To start off, please follow the setup instructions below:

#### Download the installation script and run it

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Archiconda/build-tools/releases/download/0.2.3/Archiconda3-0.2.3-Linux-aarch64.sh
$ sudo sh Archiconda3-0.2.3-Linux-aarch64.sh
```

#### Export the path where Archiconda is installed, replace <PATH\TO\ARCHICONDA3> to wherever it is installed

```bash
$ export PATH=<PATH\TO\ARCHICONDA3>/bin:$PATH
# ig:  export PATH=~/archiconda3/bin:$PATH
```

#### Check the version, if Conda is successfully installed, you will see the version info on the terminal.

```bash
$ conda -V
```

### To update to the latest version

```bash
$ conda update conda
$ conda -V
```

### To prevent Conda from activating the base environment by default

```bash
$ conda config --set auto_activate_base false
$ export "PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ which python3
```

## How To Use

### Create/Delete an environment

#### To create an environment

```bash
$ conda create --name envname (replace envname in your preference)
```

#### To create an environment with a specific version of Python

```bash
$ conda create -n envname python=3.6 (replace envname in your preference)
```

#### To delete an environment

```bash
$ conda remove -n envname --all (replace envname in your preference)
```

#### To remove an environment

```bash
$ conda remove -n envname --all (replace envname in your preference)
```

### Grant the current user permission

```bash
$ sudo chown -R username <PATH\TO>/archiconda
```

### Activate/Deactivate the environment

#### To activate the environment

```bash
$ conda activate envname (replace envname in your preference)
```

#### To deactivate the environment

```bash
$ conda deactivate
```

#### To prevent conda from activating the base environment by default

```bash
$ conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```

### Packages installation within an environment

#### To install a specific package such as SciPy into an existing environment--

```bash
$ conda install --name envname pkgname
```

#### If you do not specify the environment name, which in this example is done by --name myenv, the package installs into the current environment

```bash
$ conda install pkgname
```

#### Upgrade pip

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### Check pip version (Note please make sure you check the path of the pip, or the packages installed with pip/pip3 might not be installed in the conda environment)

```bash
$ which pip3
```

### Run jupyter notebook/lab inside the conda virtualenv

```bash
$ sudo chown -R username <PATH\TO>/archiconda
$ conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
$ conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
$ pip3 install --upgrade --force jupyter-console
```

#### Add an env to jupyter

```bash
$ ipykernel install --user --name=envname (replace envname in your preference)
```

#### Remove an env from jupyter

```bash
$ jupyter kernelspec uninstall envname (replace envname in your preference)
```

#### List the existing environments

```bash
$ jupyter kernelspec list
```

## Run jupyter lab remotely from your client machine

For instance, you may open jupter notebook/lab from a windows/mac machine a client.

In the server machine, type the following commands:

```bash
$ jupyter lab --generate-config
$ sudo find / -name jupyter*notebook_config.py #it will display the path of the config file
$ vi <PATH\TO\CONFIG>/jupyter_notebook_config.py
# you may change the settings in your own preference.*
```

In your local client machine type the following commands:

```bash
$ rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts
$ ssh -L 8000:localhost:PORT username*@server_ip #check the port by opening jupter lab, the default is 8888 \
```

Note: you may change 8000 to whatever # in your preference

for example: `ssh -L 8000:localhost:9999 kev@10.10.10.65`

type the adrress with the customized in the web browser localhost:8000

#### first-time login

1. Copy the token from the server terminal
2. Open a web browse from the client, type localhost:PORT (localhost:8000 as default), then it will promot up a windows to ask you to type in the token, just paste the token, and you should be good to go.
